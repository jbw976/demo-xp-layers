# Elevate Your Infrastructure: Exploring Crossplane's Full Potential

 Crossplane ( https://www.crossplane.io/) and its user experience has matured
 greatly over the years and there are now numerous layers you can interact with
 while designing and building your internal developer platform powered by
 Crossplane.
 
 Should you directly declare the cloud resources you want Crossplane
 to create, should you create developer friendly simplified abstractions on top,
 should you stick with YAML or use a more full featured high level programming
 language?
 
 We will explore each of these layers in further detail through live
 demos to understand and efficiently harness the capabilities and experience of
 each. This will be a broad tour through the possibilities offered by
 Crossplane, all of which lead to a reliable and robust control plane to manage
 everything in the cloud that your organization could need!
